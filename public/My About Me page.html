<p>I’m a self-taught web developer currently sharpening my skills through hands-on learning and real-world projects. Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a Virtual Assistant specializing in social media marketing, where I helped brands grow their online presence and connect with their audience. That experience gave me a strong foundation in user behavior, branding, and digital strategy — skills I now bring into every website I build.</p>

<p>I approach development with curiosity and adaptability. Coming from a marketing background, I understand that a website isn’t just code — it’s a tool that serves a purpose. I enjoy breaking down client needs, researching unfamiliar technologies when necessary, and figuring things out until I can deliver what’s required. If I don’t know something yet, I treat it as a problem to solve — not a limitation.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a well-rounded, flexible developer who can adapt to different project requirements and continuously grow with the industry. I’m currently focused on strengthening my technical foundation while building projects that challenge me to think beyond tutorials. I’m excited to collaborate, learn, and create digital solutions that are both functional and meaningful.</p>

<p>Let's build something impactful.</p>
